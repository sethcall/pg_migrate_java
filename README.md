pg_migrate_java
===============

Java pg_migrate manifest builder and migration runner.





Building the project
--------------------
Developer environment requirements:
* make
* javac 
* jar
* an environment variable called IVY, which is a full path to a apache-ivy-2.3.0-rc1-bin-with-deps.zip


Ivy Downloads are available here: http://ant.apache.org/ivy/download.cgi.  I've defined my IVY environment variable in ~/.bash_profile, like so:
 
`export IVY=/Users/seth/workspace/apache-ivy-2.3.0-rc1/ivy-2.3.0-rc1.jar`
